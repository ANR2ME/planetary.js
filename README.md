Planetary.js is based on [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson). It has built-in support for zoom, rotation, mouse interaction, and displaying animated "pings" at any coordinate. Via plugins, Planetary.js can be extended to do whatever you want!

Examples, documentation, and more can be found at [planetaryjs.com](http://planetaryjs.com/).
